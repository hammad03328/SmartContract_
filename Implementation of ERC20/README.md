The ERC20 standard is a widely adopted standard for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of functions and events that a smart contract must implement to be considered ERC20-compliant[3].

Here is a short description related to the implementation of ERC20 basic functions:

totalSupply(): 
This function returns the total supply of tokens that the contract holds[6]. It provides information about the total number of tokens in circulation.
balanceOf(address _owner): 
This function returns the token balance of a specific address. It takes an address parameter and returns the balance of tokens held by that address[3]. It allows users and applications to check the balance of tokens held by a particular account.
transfer(address _to, uint256 _value): 
This function is used to transfer tokens from the sender's account to another address. It takes the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to be transferred as parameters[4]. It updates the balances of the sender and recipient accordingly.
approve(address _spender, uint256 _value): 
This function allows the token owner to give permission to another address (spender) to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. It takes the spender's address and the maximum amount of tokens to be spent as parameters[3]. This function is typically used in scenarios where an application or contract needs to spend tokens on behalf of a user.
allowance(address _owner, address _spender):
 This function returns the remaining number of tokens that the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner[3]. It helps users and applications keep track of the approved spending limit for a particular address.
transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value):
This function is used to transfer tokens from one address to another on behalf of the token owner. It requires prior approval through the approve function. It takes the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the amount of tokens to be transferred as parameters[3]. This function is commonly used when an application or contract needs to transfer tokens on behalf of a user.
These functions form the basic functionality of an ERC20 token. Implementing them in a smart contract allows the token to be compatible with other ERC20 tokens and enables users to interact with the token using standard interfaces and wallets.

It's important to note that while these functions are the core of the ERC20 standard, additional optional functions and events can be implemented to enhance the token's functionality and usability[3][13].
